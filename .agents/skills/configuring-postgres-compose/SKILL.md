# Configuring Postgres Compose & Connection Pooling

## Overview
PostgreSQL in Docker Compose and Go should be configured for security, persistence, isolation, service readiness, and reliable pool management.

## When to Use
- Adding or configuring a PostgreSQL service using Docker/Podman Compose.
- Writing Makefile cleanup targets that spawn and destroy test containers.
- Setting up or tuning the database connection package in Go (e.g. `sqlx` parameters).
- Implementing database retry pings and connection pool stats observability.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Verify Docker Compose configuration**: Read `assets/docker-compose.yml.template` and apply the configurations for development/testing environments, ensuring container health checks are enabled via `pg_isready`. Audit environment declarations in all compose files to eliminate dead or unused variables (such as unused API URLs).
2. **Add Makefile teardown targets**: Read `references/makefile-targets.md` and add necessary commands to stop and remove containers cleanly, avoiding network bridge locks under Podman.
3. **Configure connection pooling in Go**: Read `assets/db-connection.go.template` and implement connection pooling in your database setup, ensuring connection health is verified with individual context timeouts during startup retries.
4. **Expose database connection statistics**: Expose `DB.Stats()` to track pool exhaustion and monitor database health under loaded states.

## Common Mistakes
- **No Individual Context timeouts**: Creating a single context outside the retry loop, causing later ping retries to fail immediately if the connection takes time.
- **Hanging Networks**: Relying only on `compose down` under Podman. Always stop and force-remove containers by name first.
- **No Observability**: Storing the DB connection globally without exposing `db.DB.Stats()` to track pool exhaustion.
- **No Ping Verification**: Running `sqlx.Open` without verifying connection viability using `.PingContext()`.
- **No Application-Level Readiness Wait**: Using `pg_isready` to verify database health but not waiting for the backend API (`/api/health`) and frontend dev server to be ready before running E2E tests. Makefile targets that orchestrate test environments must include wait steps for all services, not just the database.
- **Mixing Container Runtimes in Makefile**: When both Docker and Podman are installed, `CONTAINER_RUNTIME` and `COMPOSE` must be derived from the same source — never auto-detect them independently. If `CONTAINER_RUNTIME=docker`, then `COMPOSE` must resolve to `docker compose` (not `podman-compose`). Derive `COMPOSE` from `CONTAINER_RUNTIME`, or add a fail-fast guard that aborts when they point at different daemons. Example:
  ```makefile
  # ✗ BAD: each variable detected independently — can mix podman-compose with docker inspect
  CONTAINER_RUNTIME ?= $(shell command -v podman || echo docker)
  COMPOSE ?= $(shell command -v podman-compose || echo docker compose)

  # ✓ GOOD: COMPOSE derived from CONTAINER_RUNTIME
  CONTAINER_RUNTIME ?= $(shell if command -v podman >/dev/null 2>&1; then echo podman; else echo docker; fi)
  ifeq ($(CONTAINER_RUNTIME),podman)
    COMPOSE ?= podman-compose
  else
    COMPOSE ?= docker compose
  endif
  ```
